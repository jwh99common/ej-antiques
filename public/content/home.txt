<h1>Welcome to EJ's Antiques</h1>



At Ellerby-Jones Antiques and Collectables, we believe antiques, art and collectables are more than objects — they are expressions of taste, character, and a meaningful connection to the past.

We curate and offer a selection of rare and unique pieces, each chosen for its craftsmanship, beauty, and historical significance.

Owning an antique allows you to hold a tangible piece of history, offering insight into past eras of fashion, design and craftsmanship. Each item carries its own story, and by bringing it into your home, you become a part of its journey.

By choosing antiques, you help preserve these treasures and ensure their stories continue to be appreciated for generations to come. 



<h2> THE ABOUT </h2> 

My name is Harry Ellerby-Jones, and I am a father living with my family in Bedfordshire. My passion for antiques began with collecting wall art, and over the years it has grown into a varied and fascinating collection that ranges from 900-year-old etchings, 18th-century watercolours to modern art.

With Ellerby-Jones Antiques and Collectables, my mission is to place high-quality, beautiful items into the hands of collectors — pieces that can be enjoyed not only for their craftsmanship but for the stories of the eras and creators behind them.

I began my academic journey studying philosophy before moving into law, ultimately building a professional career in project management, most of it spent working with the Ministry of Defence. 

I began collecting 20 years ago, encouraged and guided by a friend who had spent 40 years in the antiques trade. I began to build a number of working relationships with other collectors and dealers, including art restorers and framers.

Today, I specialise in antique artwork, ceramics, glassware and collectables, using my experience and passion to curate items that are worthy of appreciation and preservation.

I have delivered high quality pieces to customers across the world, including Europe, the USA and Australia. My items are curated with care, packaged to prevent damage in transit and thoroughly enjoyed by my customers. 

My business was primarily private sales, as well as online, but is now proud to be part of the community of antiques and art dealers located at the Antiques Association in Woburn, Bedfordshire UK.
