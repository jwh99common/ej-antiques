Product copy is persuasive writing that describes a product's features and benefits to convince a customer to buy it. Effective copy is clear, concise, and compelling, focusing on how the product solves a customer's problem, uses customer-centric language, and is easy to scan with features like bullet points. It should also tell a story, include testimonials, and be optimized for search engines (SEO).
