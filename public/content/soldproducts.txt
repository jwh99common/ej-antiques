<h1>About Sold Items & Sourcing Alternatives</h1>

Many of our pieces are one-of-a-kind — once they’re gone, they’re truly gone. But don’t worry: if something you love has already sold, we may be able to help. We’re always sourcing new treasures and have a network of trusted dealers and collectors we work with.

If you’re looking for something similar to a sold item, feel free to get in touch. Let us know what caught your eye, and we’ll do our best to find a worthy match — or even something better.
